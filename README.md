Numerical simulation of fusiform neurons in Neuron (neuron.yale.edu).

This code is part of the article "Development of electrophysiological properties of fusiform neurons from the dorsal cochlear nucleus of mice before and after hearing onset" with authors Nikollas M. Benites, Beatriz Rodrigues, Carlos H. da Silveira, Christopher Kushmerick, and Ricardo M. Le√£o*. This code was used to produce Figure 10.
